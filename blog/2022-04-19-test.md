# What is Qubic?

## In a Nutshell

Qubic is a crypto platform founded by Sergey Ivancheglo, aka Come-From-Beyond, who is known for developing IOTA and NXT crypto projects,

The name Qubic comes from the abbreviation QBC – quorum-based computation. There are 676 Computors in the System that execute smart contracts, as soon as calculations with the same result have been produced by a quorum of computors (⅔+ from 676= 451), the result is considered reliable, finalized, and additional confirmations do not increase reliability. Each Computer has mining capacities that produce useful calculations - AI training, as a result, unlike classical crypto platforms, where a huge amount of electricity and computing power are burned by miners purely on mining, as such, Qubic has Useful Proof-of-Work.
