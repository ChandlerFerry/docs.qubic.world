# Quorum

## What is Quorum?
A quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present at a meeting or assembly in order for official business to be conducted. The number of members needed to form a quorum is typically defined by the rules or bylaws of the organization holding the meeting.

In many cases, a quorum is required for decisions to be made or votes to be taken. Without a quorum, a meeting may not be able to proceed or any actions taken may be considered invalid.

For example, if the bylaws of a club state that a quorum is a majority of its members, then at least half of the members would need to be present at a meeting for any official business to take place.
