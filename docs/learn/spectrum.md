# Spectrum

In the context of the Qubic network, the "Spectrum" refers to its distributed ledger where all the transaction data is stored. The term is equivalent to what is commonly referred to as the "blockchain" in other digital currency networks. However, the use of a different term signifies Qubic's divergence from traditional blockchain architecture.

Much like a blockchain, the Spectrum records all transactions made within the network. It holds the complete transaction history and the state of every smart contract executed. However, instead of being organized into blocks and chained together sequentially, the Spectrum's structure aligns with Qubic's unique protocol.

Computors in the Qubic network process transactions and maintain the Spectrum. This process includes executing transactions, running smart contracts, and updating the state of the Spectrum. To incentivize this, Computors receive rewards in the form of Qubic's native token, QU, for their role in maintaining the Spectrum.

Essentially, the Spectrum is the backbone of the Qubic network, ensuring transparency, security, and the accurate state of all data related to transactions and contracts within the system.
