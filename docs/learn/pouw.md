# Proof of usefull work

Proof of Useful Work (PoUW) is a novel consensus mechanism that seeks to transform the computational energy expended in the mining process into valuable, useful outcomes. This protocol evolved as a solution to the criticism levelled against traditional Proof of Work (PoW) protocols, which consume substantial energy to solve computationally intensive problems, primarily for the sake of maintaining the network's security.

Within the Qubic ecosystem, PoUW is deployed in a distinctive manner. Instead of having AI miners dedicate computational power to solving random, often meaningless problems, the protocol directs this power towards the training of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This harnesses the immense computational capacity of the network for the progression of machine learning, contributing to meaningful, real-world applications.

Under the PoUW protocol in Qubic, the ranking of Computors hinges on the effectiveness of their AI miners in solving these complex problems. This mining operation's main objective is not the validation of transactions or creation of new blocks, as seen in conventional PoW systems. Instead, it's for establishing a Computor's ranking for each epoch, which is a time period of one week.

The system identifies the top 676 Computors, based on their AI miners' performance, to qualify for an epoch. The better a Computor's miner performs, the higher its ranking, and subsequently, its potential earnings.

The PoUW protocol adds a layer of energy efficiency to the Qubic network. It ensures that the energy used in mining is directed towards real-world problem-solving, such as machine learning tasks, beyond merely maintaining network security. This strategy increases the overall utility of the network, making it beneficial not only for network maintenance but also for external applications and services.
