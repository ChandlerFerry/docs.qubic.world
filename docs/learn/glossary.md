# Glossary

The following terms are used throughout the Qubic documentation and development ecosystem.

## QU
QUs or Qubic Units is the native token and positioned as equivalent of "energy" units spent to run smart-contract and access other services in Qubic (e.g. donations to oracles). Yes, QUs can be used as money, but they are more than that. Transfers are feeless and notion of "fee" for smart contracts doesn't make much sense, because qus are destroyed, not given to computors. When one asks an oracle he "burns" QUs as a sacrifice, not as a payment, it's not even guaranteed that the oracle will answer. 

## Epoch
A one-week time period from Wednesday 12 UTC to Wednesday 12 UTC during which 1 trillion QUs are generated.

## Spectrum
Qubic's equivalent of a ledger

## Identity
Qubic's equivalent of an address

## Energy
The amount of QUs per identity on the Spectrum instead of (similar to "balance").

## Quorum
A quorum is the minimum number of computors necessary to conduct any sort of business. In qubic the [Quorum](/learn/quorum) is â…” (or 451) of all Computors to reach consensus.

## Computor
[Computors](/learn/computor) refer to the machines or nodes that participate in the network's consensus protocol and perform computation tasks. They are a critical component of the Qubic network, responsible for executing transactions on the Spectrum and running smart contracts.

## Arbitrator
An entity within the Qubic ecosystem responsible for resolving disputes and protecting user interests. The arbitrator sets parameters of the mining algorithm, publishes lists of computors every epoch, is developing the capacity to replace faulty computors, and accumulates QUs not received by underperforming computors. Each node operator individually selects their arbitrator by setting the corresponding ID in Qubic.cpp. The entity controlling the current arbitrator remains unknown, though rumors suggest it's operated by the development team.

## Useful Proof of Work (UPoW)
A novel consensus mechanism that optimizes the energy expended in mining processes by directing computational power towards valuable, real-world tasks, such as training artificial intelligence models. Unlike traditional Proof of Work systems that "waste" energy by solving abstract puzzles, [UPoW](/learn/upow) contributes to meaningful applications.

## Oracles
A feature in development for Qubic. In blockchain technology, oracles are third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information, enabling them to interact with the outside world.

## Smart Contracts
Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. Qubic's first smart contract was an Initial Public Offering (IPO) of 676 shares for a decentralized exchange (DEX) named Qx.

Please note that Qubic is still in development, and some aspects of the system are subject to change during the development and practical testing phase. No official whitepaper is available as of yet due to this ongoing development process.
