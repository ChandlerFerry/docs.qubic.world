# Glossary

The following terms are used throughout the Qubic documentation and development ecosystem.

## QU
QUs or Qubic Units is the native token and positioned as equivalent of "energy" units spent to run smart-contract and access other services in Qubic (e.g. donations to oracles). Yes, QUs can be used as money, but they are more than that. Transfers are feeless and notion of "fee" for smart contracts doesn't make much sense, because qus are destroyed, not given to computors. When one asks an oracle he "burns" QUs as a sacrifice, not as a payment, it's not even guaranteed that the oracle will answer. 

## Spectrum
Qubic's equivalent of a ledger

## Identity
Qubic's equivalent of an address

## Energy
The amount of QUs per identity on the Spectrum instead of (similar to "balance").

## Quorum
A quorum is the minimum number of computors necessary to conduct any sort of business. In qubic the [Quorum](/learn/quorum) is â…” (or 451) of all Computors to reach consensus.

## Computor
[Computors](/learn/computor) refer to the machines or nodes that participate in the network's consensus protocol and perform computation tasks. They are a critical component of the Qubic network, responsible for executing transactions on the Spectrum and running smart contracts.
