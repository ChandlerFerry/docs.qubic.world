# Qubic Tokenomics

In the world of Qubic, the utility token driving the ecosystem is not a mere currency but an 'energy' unit. These units, known as Qubic Units (Qus), serve as the fuel for executing smart contracts and accessing other services on the Qubic platform. Unlike traditional monetary units, Qus are burned when used, which is a fundamental concept in understanding the unique tokenomics of Qubic.

## Qubic Units (QUs)
QUs act as a measurement of computational 'energy' spent on the Qubic platform. Whether it's running smart contracts or seeking data from oracles, the consumption of Qus is the bedrock of transactions within the system. It's vital to note that QUs, while having a value, are not 'paid' to the system entities ([Computors](/learn/computor)). Instead, they are 'burned' or permanently removed from circulation, contributing to a balance between inflation and deflation in the Qubic economy.

## Epoch and QU Generation
Each epoch, which lasts seven days, generates 1 trillion QUs. These units are primarily distributed among the Computors, the essential nodes of the Qubic network. The maximum revenue per Computor, in case of maximum efficiency, is 1 trillion divided by 676 QUs. The distribution model for Qus incentivizes efficiency in the network, as less efficient Computors will receive reduced revenue. The remaining portion goes to the Administrator, whose role is confined to managing AI training tasks, without any influence over smart contracts, voting, or Qus distribution, thus maintaining a balance in the Qubic economic system.

## Transfers and Fees
Qubic stands apart from traditional systems with its approach to transfers and fees. Transfers within the Qubic network are **feeless**, contributing to the efficiency and user-friendly nature of the platform. Furthermore, 'fees' associated with executing smart contracts are not fees in the traditional sense. These Qus are burned and not given to Computors, further reinforcing the concept of Qus as 'energy' rather than money.

## The Role of Computors
Computors in the Qubic system play an instrumental role in maintaining its economic balance. They perform tasks assigned by the Administrator and vote by [Quorum](/learn/quorum) to determine the size of the commission for executing smart contracts. Interestingly, this commission does not become the Computors' income. Instead, it is burned, adjusting the inflation or deflation of Qus in the ecosystem.

## The Administrator
The Administrator oversees the assignment of AI training tasks in Qubic but does not exert influence over smart contract execution, voting procedures, or Qus distribution. This segregation of roles aids in maintaining the decentralized nature of the platform.

## Smart Contracts   
Execution of smart contracts on Qubic typically requires a commission, unlike many other crypto platforms. However, this commission does not go into the pockets of the Computors, but rather it is burned. The size of the commission is determined through a quorum vote by the Computors, effectively creating a mechanism for automatic adjustment of inflation or deflation.

In essence, QU serve as the lifeblood of the Qubic network, driving its operations, incentivizing efficiency, and maintaining a balance in the tokenomics through a system of rewards and burns. The unique role of QUs within the network design underlines the adaptive, efficient, and democratic nature of the Qubic platform.
