# Community Bounty Q005: Logo Design for Qubic

**Proposed by:** Zoxx

**Estimated Completion Time:** 1 Month

## Project Overview

The visual identity of any project, especially a logo, plays a significant role in the way it is perceived. A memorable and meaningful logo can provide a solid foundation for a brand's identity, conveying the project's ethos and values in a simple yet powerful visual form. Therefore, this proposal is aimed at creating a distinctive logo for Qubic that is representative of our technology, vision, and community.

## Scope of Work

1. **Market Research:** Understanding the landscape of blockchain and cryptocurrency logos to ensure uniqueness and relevance.
2. **Conceptualization:** Creating initial logo concepts that embody Qubic's core values and align with its brand image.
3. **Iteration & Refinement:** Refining chosen concepts, incorporating community feedback to finalize the logo.
4. **Delivery:** Delivering final logo in multiple formats suitable for various platforms (website, social media, print, etc.), along with a usage guide.
5. **Revision:** Should the need arise, one round of revision will be provided based on the community's feedback.

## Compensation

Given the potential impact of this work on Qubic's brand identity and visibility, the proposed budget is 5 bln QUs. This accounts for the time and expertise required for each step of the process, as well as potential expenses related to software usage and other resources.

Please note, payment is contingent upon satisfactory delivery of the finalized logo and all related deliverables. Funds will only be relased if the final [Proposal](/learn/proposals) passes the [Quorum](/learn/quorum) voting.
